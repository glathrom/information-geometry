\section{Background}

Information Geometry is a area which combines Differential Geometry,
Probability Theory and Information Theory into one discipline.  Because of
this, it is somewhat difficult to get a grasp on all of the concepts which go
into Information Theory.  By molding these three disciplines together we also
see connections between Physics and Machine Learning also with implications
for Artificial Intelligence.  Let's just see where all of these things take
us, while supplementing necessary background along the way.  One of the books
of interest will be \cite{dodson} along with a collection of papers available
\href{https://mega.nz/folder/5w0CDDzR\#EUMxMbyRJdNSKsqKIuEyFg}{here}.  We begin
with the connection between Information Geometry and Mechanics using
\cite{leok1} as the guide.
